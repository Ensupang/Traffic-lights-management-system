[ECE650]: The project is to help the local police department with their installation 
of security cameras at traffic intersections. In this assignment, I will solve a particular 
kind of optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, in this context. 
The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need 
to install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.

Technologies: Python, C++,  Linux, Git, CMake, Pipe, Fork, Multithreading, Multiprocessing. 

5 files included, one was written in Python, the other four were written in C++. 

Used Pipe and Fork in C++ to connect at least 3 files, making them run concurrently, including a Python file and other C++ files. 

Used SAT Solver to solve vertex cover problem. 

Multithreading technique was applied to solve vertex cover problem in different ways.
